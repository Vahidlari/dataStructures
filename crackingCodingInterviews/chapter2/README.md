# Chapter 2: Linked Lists

This folder contains my solutions to the problems from Chapter 2 ("Linked Lists") of *Cracking the Coding Interview*.

## Topics Covered
- Singly and doubly linked lists
- Node manipulation
- List partitioning and intersection
- Loop detection

## Problems Solved

1. **Remove Dups**  
   *Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.*

2. **Return Kth to Last**  
   *Return the kth to last element of a singly linked list.*

3. **Delete Middle Node**  
   *Delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.*

4. **Partition**  
   *Partition a linked list around a value x.*

5. **Sum Lists**  
   *Add two numbers represented by linked lists.*

6. **Palindrome**  
   *Check if a linked list is a palindrome.*

7. **Intersection**  
   *Determine if two linked lists intersect and return the intersecting node.*

8. **Loop Detection**  
   *Detect if a linked list has a loop and return the node at the start of the loop.*

Each solution is implemented in its own source/header files, with corresponding unit tests under the `tests/` directory.
